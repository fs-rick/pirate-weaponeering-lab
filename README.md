# The Pirate Weaponeering Lab

The Pirate Weaponeering Lab project is a code base for weaponeering methods and experiments in the R programming language.

The methods are mostly, if not all, taken from the first edition (2004) of Professor Morris Driels's book Weaponeering: Conventional Weapon System Effectiveness, ISBN 1-56347-665-7.  We try to annotate the code with comments noting the equation or page numbers of Driels that correspond to it.  There is a second edition of the book, published in 2013 -- that is not a source for this code base (yet).
